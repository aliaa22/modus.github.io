<p> One of the real joys of the holiday season is the opportunity to say thank you to business process owners such as yourself. Without you, we wouldn't be able to provide employees with reliable and up-to-date information to do their jobs and make our department a better place to work. Please accept this token of our appreciation for your continued efforts and support in making Modus a success.</p>
